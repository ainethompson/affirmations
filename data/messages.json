["Dont let yesterday take up too much of today",
"Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can",
"I am learning everyday to let the space between where I am and where I want to be inspire me and not terrify me",
"Do more things [today] that make you forget to check your phone",
"May the flowers remind us why the rain was so necessary",
"Remember when you so badly wanted what you currently have?",
"Visualize your highest self, and start showing up as her",
"There’s a future version of me who’s proud I was strong enough",
"When you finally learn that a person's behavior has more to do with their own internal struggle than it ever did with you... you learn grace",
"You need people in your life that are further along than you, people that have a bigger vision, people that are more experienced, people that are out of your league. You need to be exposed to new levels so that you can go to new levels!"]
