["Dont let yesterday take up too much of today",
"Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can",
"I am learning everyday to let the space between where I am and where I want to be inspire me and not terrify me",
"Do more things [today] that make you forget to check your phone",
"May the flowers remind us why the rain was so necessary",
"Remember when you so badly wanted what you currently have?",
"Visualize your highest self, and start showing up as her",
"There’s a future version of me who’s proud I was strong enough",
"When you finally learn that a person's behavior has more to do with their own internal struggle than it ever did with you... 
you learn grace",
"You need people in your life that are further along than you, people that have a bigger vision, people that are more experienced, 
people that are out of your league. You need to be exposed to new levels so that you can go to new levels!",
"Perfectionism is a lie. Start messy",
"I can totally do this",
"Remember your goal and why you started.",
"It's your story, babe. Feel free to hit 'em with a plot twist whenever you want.",
"They never tell you, the more you bring to the table, the harder it is to find someone to eat with.",
"Just because you can take it, doesn't mean you have to. Suffering is not a superpower.",
"If you had a friend who spoke to you the same way you speak to yourself, how long would you allow them to stay your friend?",
"Maybe you're not healing because you're trying to be who you were before the trauma. That person doesn't exist anymore because 
there's a new you trying to be born. Breathe life into that person.",
"It takes a very strong individual to sit with themselves, calm their storms, and heal all of their issues without trying to bring someone
else into that chaos. My journey to self-love is just that and yes, I am doing it.",
"Being okay if it happens and okay if it doesn't, is a very powerful place to be."]
